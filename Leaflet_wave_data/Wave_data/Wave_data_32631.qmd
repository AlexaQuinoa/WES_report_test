  <title>Wave</title>
  <abstract>Wave data supplied by the Met Office on behalf of BERR for the Atlas of UK Marine Renewable Energy Resources project. This layer contains the primary wave data attributes from the Atlas database. This dataset includes information about Significant Wave Heights and Full Wave Field Power for the area of the UK Continental Shelf. All data recorded 2001 to 2008. For further information please refer to 2008 Renewable Atlas technical report available from http://www.renewables-atlas.info/. -------------- Further information regarding attribute headings and units is attached as binary enclosure which can be extracted using the metadata properties button in ESRI ArcCatalog or downloaded as a text file from the metadata page of http://www.renewables-atlas.info/.

  <history>The majority of the wave data is generated from the Met Office UK Waters Wave Model which provides coverage over the major part of the UKCS, with the exception of outer shelf areas which has been supplied form the Met Office Global Wave model which has a resolution of 1/9° latitude by 1/6° longitude (approximately 11km in mid-latitudes). The UK Waters Wave Model became operational in June 2000 and has an archive of results stored at hourly intervals from approximately the last 7 years. The wave models are based on a second generation spectral scheme (Golding, 1983) which can typically resolve waves with periods between 3 and 25 seconds, and deep-water wavelengths from 15 to 975m. The models are forced using the wind field 10m above mean sea-level derived by the Met Office atmospheric models, which assimilate observational data from satellite, ship and met buoy networks. It is the wind strength, duration and direction that defines the frequency and directional bins in which energy is transferred to the wave model through the process of 'wind-sea' growth. Parameterisations of the wind-sea spectral peaked-ness and peak frequency are used to select an appropriate member of the JONSWAP family of spectra to represent the growing 'wind-sea'</history>
